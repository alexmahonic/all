## 159  
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most 2 distinct characters.  
For example, Given s = “eceba”,  
T is "ece" which its length is 3.  

## 161
Given two strings S and T, determine if they are both one edit distance apart.  

## 163  
Given a sorted integer array where the range of elements are in the inclusive range [lower, upper], return its missing ranges.  
For example, given [0, 1, 3, 50, 75], lower = 0 and upper = 99, return ["2", "4->49", "51->74", "76->99"].  



## 320  
Write a function to generate the generalized abbreviations of a word.  

Example:  
Given word = "word", return the following list (order does not matter):  
```
["word", "1ord", "w1rd", "wo1d", "wor1", "2rd", "w2d", "wo2", "1o1d", "1or1", "w1r1", "1o2", "2r1", "3d", "w3", "4"]
```

## 339  
Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.  

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.  

Example 1:
```
Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]], return 10. (four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1)
```
Example 2:
```
Given the list [1,[4,[6]]], return 27. (one 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3; 1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27)
```

## 340  
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.  

For example, Given s = “eceba” and k = 2,  

T is "ece" which its length is 3.  


## 346  
Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

For example,
```
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3
```


## 356  
Given n points on a 2D plane, find if there is such a line parallel to y-axis that reflect the given points.  

Example 1:
```
Given points = [[1,1],[-1,1]], return true.
```
Example 2:
```
Given points = [[1,1],[-1,-1]], return false.
```
## 360  
Given a sorted array of integers nums and integer values a, b and c. Apply a function of the form f(x) = ax2 + bx + c to each element x in the array.  

The returned array must be in sorted order.  

Expected time complexity: O(n)  

Example:
```
nums = [-4, -2, 2, 4], a = 1, b = 3, c = 5,

Result: [3, 9, 15, 33]

nums = [-4, -2, 2, 4], a = -1, b = 3, c = 5

Result: [-23, -5, 1, 7]
```
## 369  
Given a non-negative integer represented as non-empty a singly linked list of digits, plus one to the integer.  

You may assume the integer do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.  

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.  

Example:
```
Input:
1->2->3

Output:
1->2->4
```
